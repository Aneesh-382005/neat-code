1.	Develop a menu driven program demonstrating the following operations on simple Queues: enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty(), isFull(), display(), and peek().
Note: Use either arrays or linked list to implement queue.
2.	Develop a menu driven program demonstrating the following operations on Circular Queues: enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty(), isFull(), display(), and peek().
Note: Use arrays to implement circular queue.
3.	Write a program interleave the first half of the queue with second half. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interleave-first-half-queue-second-half/
4.	Write a program to find first non-repeating character in a string using Queue. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-based-approach-for-first-non-repeating- character-in-a-stream/
