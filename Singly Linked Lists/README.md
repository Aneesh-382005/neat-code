1.	Develop a menu driven program for the following operations of on a Singly Linked List.
(a)	Insertion at the beginning.
(b)	Insertion at the end.
(c)	Insertion in between (before or after a node having a specific value, say 'Insert a new Node 35 before/after the Node 30').
(d)	Deletion from the beginning.
(e)	Deletion from the end.
(f)	Deletion of a specific node, say 'Delete Node 60').
(g)	Search for a node and display its position from head.
(h)	Display all the node values.
2.	Write a program to count the number of occurrences of a given key in a singly linked list and then delete all the occurrences. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->1-
>2->1->3->1 and given key is 1, then output should be 4. After deletion of all the occurrences of 1, the linked list is 2->2->3.
3.	Write a program to find the middle of a linked list.
