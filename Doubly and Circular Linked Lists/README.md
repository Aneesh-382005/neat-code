1.	Develop a menu driven program for the following operations of on a Circular as well as a Doubly Linked List.
(a)	Insertion anywhere in the linked list (As a first node, as a last node, and after/before a specific node).
(b)	Deletion of a specific node, say 'Delete Node 60'. That mean the node to be deleted may appear as a head node, last node or a node in between.
(c)	Search for a node.
2.	Display all the node values in a circular linked list, repeating value of head node at the end too. For example, if elements present in the circular linked list starting from head are 20 → 100 → 40 → 80 → 60, then output should be displayed as 20 100 40 80 60 20.
3.	Write a program to find size of
(a)	Doubly Linked List.

(b)	Circular Linked List.

4.	Write a program to check if a doubly linked list of characters is palindrome or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-doubly-linked-list-characters-palindrome-not/
5.	Write a program to check if a linked list is Circular Linked List or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-linked-list-is-circular-linked-list/
